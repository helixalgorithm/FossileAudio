Steinberg VST plugin Doppler effect delay with stereo ping-pong and hi-pass filter.

In order to compile it you need a Steinberg VST SDK, which is free for download from https://www.steinberg.net/en/company/developers.html

This plugin compiles to vst3. It works fine but has some bugs. Do not mute the plugin or its channel prior to exit.

Next steps are multithread processing and bugfixing.
